## Overview
In the fast-paced world of web development, testing plays a crucial role in ensuring the quality and reliability of web applications. Automation testing has become an essential part of the testing process, as it allows for faster and more efficient validation of web apps across various platforms and configurations.

- Selenium Libraries Integrated into Java
- BaseDriver and MyMethods Classes for Enhanced Testing

The BaseDriver class serves as the foundation for our test automation. It sets up the WebDriver instance, which is crucial for browser automation using Selenium. The class performs the following tasks upon initialization:

- Close Previous Drivers
- Logger Configuration
- WebDriver Initialization
- Window Maximization
- Timeout Configurations
- Implemented Wait and Quit method
- Implemented take screen shot method

In next projects we will start using these utilities to test web applications.
